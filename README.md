# Digital Artist Prateek 

I call myself the pure breed of engineers.  

Engineering is a mindset. It not related to tech at all. Engineering is what helped humans to survive/sustain themselves. 
A engineer is an alter ego of an artist. Generally work of artists subjective whereas engineers work is objective. Just like artists they are curious. 

Lets talk about history of this engineering mindset.
There was a time when humans were hi ting for food. Engineers realized its not a scalable approach so they invented farming and solved the problem of  starting from zero for food. 
The interesting this is they jump from one thing to another. From agriculture revolution they have done great thing for themselves. 
They revolutionised industries in the last century. They need a way to mass produce items for them. They also worked on automobiles and solved the commute problem for them and stopped. If you see the automobiles of this decade. They are just efficient versions of last century. Basically engineers are patching their creations to handle scale(population). Same is the case is agriculture. What they did back then was very good for the population of that time. But now things are a bit different. 

Now they have jumped to Soft Tech(Internet). After working in hard things they invented soft world from them and oh boy. Soft Tech has grown like the big bang. It’s growing exponentially and got so much potential in it. They believe that it can solve almost all of their problems. When does this Soft Tech sprint end for the engineers? Well it will end when everything is automated. And we humans are left with things we used to back before agriculture revolution. Enjoy each other’s company.
It will take them this century though.



Hmm
So whats next for the engineers? 

Aliens, time, or even god?
