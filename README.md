# Digital Artist Prateek 

I proudly embody the essence of a true-blooded engineer.

Engineering isn't just about technology; it's a mindset that encompasses far more. It's deeply rooted in humanity's survival and sustenance throughout the ages. An engineer is an artist's alter ego, yet with a crucial distinction: our work is grounded in objectivity rather than subjectivity. Just like artists, we engineers possess an insatiable curiosity that drives us forward. If you're hungry for more knowledge, I invite you to dive into this captivating [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/AskPK123/status/1231329149039464448).

Let's journey into the historical foundations of the engineering mindset. In the past, our ancestors relied on hunting for their nourishment. However, we engineers quickly realized that this approach wasn't scalable. So, we ingeniously devised farming—a solution that solved the problem of starting from scratch when it came to food.

But here's what's truly fascinating about us engineers: we never stop pushing boundaries. From the agricultural revolution onward, we engineers have consistently achieved remarkable feats. We spearheaded revolutionary changes across industries throughout the previous century, introducing mass production techniques and conquering transportation challenges through the creation of automobiles. Sure, today's vehicles may appear as mere refinements of their predecessors, but don't be fooled. Engineers have masterfully fine-tuned their creations to accommodate the ever-expanding population. The same principle applies to agriculture: the methods that served us well in the past may not be suitable for the present circumstances.

And now, we've set our sights on Soft-Tech—the vast world of the Internet. After conquering the realm of tangible challenges, we engineers have harnessed the immense power of the digital domain, and the results have been nothing short of extraordinary. Soft-Tech has experienced explosive growth, brimming with boundless potential. We firmly believe that it holds the key to solving nearly all our problems. So, when will this relentless sprint into Soft-Tech reach its conclusion for us engineers? Well, it won't be until automation permeates every aspect of our lives, allowing us humans to relish the simple pleasures we enjoyed before the agricultural revolution—such as the genuine connection with our fellow human beings.

However, achieving this remarkable transformation may well take us until the end of this century.

So, what lies ahead for us engineers?

Aliens, time travel, or even the realms of divinity?

## And now, I come face-to-face with the burning question that fuels my passion:

How can we effectively tame the vast expanse of unstructured knowledge created by humanity?

I yearn to organize my thoughts, to navigate the labyrinth of my mind with the utmost efficiency. I desire nothing less than an internal search engine capable of retrieving any piece of information at the blink of an eye. :b
