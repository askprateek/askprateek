Hey folks, Prateek here. I live here in Faridabad (Delhi NCR)

I'm Engineer and athlete. 

I'm playing with computers since 2005 when I got my first computer. A Celeron 2.8Ghz machine with 256 MB of Ram.

I've spent a good amount of time with computers, breaking them, fixing them, and building my operating system. 
After 2008 got an internet connection. Started Blogging, and designing. Learned Photoshop because I wanted to have a wallpaper
for myself. I wrote north of 125 articles in a couple of years. Then the engineering entrances came in. 

I went to YMCA Faridabad and finished college back in 2017 with not-so-good marks but enough skills to land myself the tech job I wanted. I joined SocialCops, Now Atlan (AData Intelligence company in New Delhi) as Frontend Engineer. Learned Full product engineering, backend, frontend, mobile, DevOps, and Marketing. Whatever is possible. Then finally started my own company back in 2020. :)
